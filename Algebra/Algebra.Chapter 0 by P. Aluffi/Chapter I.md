# Chapter I.Preliminaries: Set theory and categories
## 1. Naive set theory
### 1.1. Sets.
*Set* -'Collection of objects'. A set is determined by the *elements* it contains. $ A = \{1,2,3\}$
<br>*Multiset* - a set, in which the elements are allowed to appear 'with multiplicity'. $ B = \{1,2,2,3\}$
<br>*Singleton* - set, consisting of 1 element. $ C = \{2\}$
<br>A few famous sets are:

### 1.2. Inclusion of sets.
We say that a set $ S $ is a *subset* of a set $ T $ if every element of $ S $ is an element of $ T $, in symbols, $ S \subseteq T $.
<br>The symbol $ |S| $ denotes the *number of elements* of $ S $. 
<br>If $ S $ and $ T $ are finite, then, obviously $ S \subseteq T \implies |S| \leq |T| $.
<br>*Power set* - a set of the subsets of a set $ S $. The power set of $ S $ is denoted $ \mathcal{P}(S) $, also can be denoted $ 2^{S} $, that is because of a fact, that $ |\mathcal{P}(S)| = 2^{|S|} $
### 1.3. Operations between sets.
